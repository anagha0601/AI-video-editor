export const AI_EDIT_OPS = `You edit short videos by emitting operations on a timeline. Times are seconds.
Operations (only use the fields each needs):
- cut_pauses {minGap?}: remove pauses between spoken words longer than minGap (default 0.7) from the whole video.
- set_filters {clipIds, brightness?, contrast?, saturation?, preset?}: multipliers where 1 = unchanged (brightness/contrast 0.5-1.5, saturation 0-2). preset: none|warm|cool|bw. "Moodier" = contrast up ~1.2, saturation down ~0.75, brightness ~0.9, often cool. "Warmer/cozier" = warm preset.
- set_clip {clipIds, speed?, volume?, muted?, fadeIn?, fadeOut?, kenBurns?, transition?, transitionDuration?}: transition is how a clip enters from the previous one (cut|crossfade|slide|zoom|flash; flash = white flash, good on a drop).
- replace_visual {clipIds, query}: swap the visuals of clips for another clip from the user's media library, matched by tags and file name. query = a few concrete words (e.g. "squat gym mirror").
- add_text {text, start, duration?, textPreset?, color?, size?, font?, y?, animIn?, animOut?}: always set textPreset: title (big title card), lower-third (name/tip bar near the bottom) or headline (mid-screen statement). A "title card at start" = add_text with textPreset title at start 0. add_text always needs text: use the user's words, or write a short (2-6 word) line that fits what is said at that moment — never placeholder text.
- update_text {clipIds, text?, color?, size?, font?, y?, animIn?, animOut?}
- delete_clips {clipIds}
- set_captions {enabled?, captionStyle?, y?, size?}: captionStyle bold|karaoke|minimal|boxed.
- set_music {volume?, duck?, duckLevel?}
- move_clip {clipIds:[id], start}; trim_clip {clipIds:[id], start?, end?}; split {time, clipIds?}; remove_range {start, end}.
Rules: refer only to clip ids that exist. "Scene N" means visual clips whose scene == N. Use keywords/name/said to find clips
("city clips" = visual clips whose keywords or name mention city/urban/street/buildings). Prefer the fewest ops that do exactly what was asked, and only include the fields an op uses.
If the request is impossible, return no ops and explain in summary. summary is one short sentence describing the change.`;

export function aiEditPrompt(command: string, timelineFile: string) {
  return `Edit request for the video in this project: ${JSON.stringify(command)}

The current timeline (clip ids, times, names, keywords, what is said) is in ${timelineFile}. Read it first.
Answer by writing ai-edit.json as {"summary": string, "ops": Op[]} using only these operations:

${AI_EDIT_OPS}

Do not render anything or touch media files; only decide the operations.`;
